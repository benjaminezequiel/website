### Introduction

I've always been deeply interested in the principles of visual communication, and in the years leading up to my thesis, I developed a passion for physical tools (like those from [The Ugly Lab](https://theuglylab.com.br/)) that facilitate creative processes. These interests converged in the creation of a project that helps designers explore their ideas: a tool to expand their visual horizons.

I spent almost a year developing this project, from in-depth theoretical research to extensive exploration and testing, always striving to create the best possible tool. This case study documents my process, hoping to help others interested in developing projects that facilitate creative thinking.

### The Problem

Through studying literature about the creative process, I discovered an interesting problem that emerges from two key premises from Jorge and Jardim (2018):

> "Projects are created through a sequence of decisions, where the designer acts as an active agent in solving a problem"

> "The repertoire and previous experiences of design professionals are determining factors in the decision-making process"

This raises an important question: <span class='highlight'>**how can we help designers at the beginning of their careers**</span>, who haven't yet built a robust repertoire, to understand and make design decisions while learning their craft? This became the central focus of my project.

### Understanding the Challenge

Through extensive research involving:
In-depth interviews with design professors and professionals
Surveys with design students and recent graduates
Analysis of similar tools and educational materials
Testing early concepts with potential users

I discovered that the challenge wasn't just about making theory more accessible - it was about creating a bridge between knowledge and application that felt natural and engaging.
Development Process
Content Development
The first major task was analyzing over 250 design principles from various authors. This involved:

Identifying patterns and commonalities
Categorizing principles by their application
Translating complex concepts into clear, actionable language
Organizing the final selection into four intuitive categories: Properties, Fundamentals, Strategies, and Gestalt principles

### Visual Language

Creating the visual identity was particularly challenging as it needed to:

- Demonstrate the principles it was teaching
- Feel approachable yet professional
- Work both individually and as a system
- Inspire creativity while maintaining clarity

The solution involved using multiple typefaces in the logo and developing abstract illustrations that could demonstrate concepts without being prescriptive. The color system helps users quickly identify different categories while creating a vibrant, engaging experience.

### Physical Design

The physical format went through multiple iterations to find the right:

- Card size for comfortable handling
- Material choices for durability
- Layout that balanced information density with clarity
- Packaging that protected the cards while being easy to use

## The Final Tool

Panorama consists of:

- 50 cards (45 principles plus category introductions)
- Custom protective packaging
- A comprehensive guidebook

Each card features:

- An abstract illustration demonstrating the principle
- A clear, concise description
- Related principles for further exploration
- Category identification through color
- Examples of practical application

## Impact & Learnings

This project taught me valuable lessons about:

- The power of physical tools in learning processes
- How to balance abstraction and clarity in educational materials
- The importance of constant user feedback
- The relationship between theory and practice in design

Most importantly, it reinforced my belief in the value of making design knowledge more accessible while respecting its complexity. Seeing how users interact with the cards and discover new possibilities in their design process has been incredibly rewarding.
Looking Forward
While Panorama was developed as a graduation project, I see potential for it to grow and evolve. The positive feedback from early users suggests there's real value in tools that bridge the gap between design theory and practice, especially for those early in their careers.

## Further Reading

For those interested in diving deeper into this project, I've made available both my complete graduation thesisÂ¹ and the presentationÂ² I gave to the graduation committee. The presentation is particularly special to me as it represents one of my best works with Figma, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with smart animations at the time.
