## Introduction

There's something _particularly challenging_ about creating your own brand. As designers, we usually spend days helping others communicate their ideas, but turning that energy towards your own expression brings a new set of obstacles. The process of being both the **client and designer** taught me new lessons I wasn't expecting.

I've had this project ready for a while now, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with it. The internet [signal-to-noise ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) is already pretty bad, and I really didn't want to push it further. But I also wanted to "put my flag on the moon", explore new ideas in visual design, and share the specific things that fascinate me — things that might resonate with you too.

As always, good work doesn't come from waiting for the perfect opportunity. Like any design project, it's about making decisions, learning from them, and eventually moving on. In this case study, I'll walk you through my process, struggles, and discoveries — hoping you might find something useful for your own journey.

## How it started

I started working on my brand in early 2023, driven partly by that desire to put myself out there, and partly by the freedom to experiment with visual ideas that didn't fit into typical client projects — weird textures, futuristic elements, ASCII art, that sort of stuff.

#### Initial exploration

I started with moodboards, pulling references from various sources (Pinterest, Cyberpunk 2077, Behance) and diving into the classic ritual of trying out hundreds of fonts. At this stage, I wasn't following any specific plan—just searching for a direction that felt right. I am always thinking of the project as a physical space, composed of solutions and challenges, and those initial explorations help me map out its boundaries.

These moodboards aren't about collecting specific elements or ideas—they're more like pinpoints on a map of visual language. They mark paths that deserve a closer look during the creation process. In my case, I found myself drawn toward more **futuristic and modern aesthetics**, particularly designs that employed multiple supporting graphic elements while maintaing a clear visual hierarchy.

#### Requirements

Unlike client work, this was pure experimentation. No briefs, no deadlines, no meetings - just me exploring whatever caught my interest and seeing where it would lead. While the freedom was exciting, it's also part of what made the project challenging. I read a few years ago (probably in an [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) book) that **constraints foster creativity**, and that insight has shaped how I think about this process of playing with ideas.

Rather than letting this become an endless exploration, I turned that insight into action. I created a set of requirements that would push me creatively while keeping the project focused:

> R01: **adapting to different names** - The system needed to work across different platforms and contexts where my full name might not fit or where I might want to use a variation

> R02: **typography variety** - I wanted the freedom to experiment with different typefaces to create richer visual communication, while maintaining a cohesive identity

> R03: **distinctive symbol** - Something unique that could stand alone and be immediately recognizable, and that could be used to identify other personal projects under the same brand

> R04: **bold colors** - A versatile color system that could be used throughout different projects, as a way to connect my experiments

With these requirements in hand, I started exploring different directions, collecting references, and sketching ideas. The rest of the article is organized in sections that explain how I worked around each requirement.

## R01: Adapting to different names

#### Anything but _Beijamim_

The first and most glaring question was: what name should I even use? Between my full name (Benjamin Ezequiel) and various nicknames (Ben, Benji, Min, Ezben), I had quite a collection to choose from. Naming is an area I have a lot of interest in, but these names were kind of already created for me.

This variety initially felt like a problem, but it opened up an interesting opportunity: instead of trying to force everything (my professional vision, hobbies, interests, opinions, artistic work) into a single identity, why not create a flexible system that could adapt to different contexts?

<div class="image-label">Experiments with a custom logotype</div>

People can get really strict about brand consistency, but I'm not sure consistency for the sake of consistency is always positive. Take Coca Cola—in 2024 they launched a campaign celebrating how their logo gets reinterpreted by local artists and shop owners around the world, embracing all these variations while keeping their essence intact.

**Brands don't exist in a perfect controlled environment, so they should adapt to their surroundings.** This idea inspired me to create something that could breathe and change while still feeling cohesive, whether it's showing up as Benjamin, Ben, Benji, or Ezben.

![Problem Illustration](/images/02-personal-brand/ezben_i04.svg)

<div class="image-label">First set of versions and variations</div>

After a couple of tries, I landed on a solid idea: a lightly altered version of [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk) with variations in both content and layout. It worked well and was flexible enough that I could apply it to different things and contexts. In the process, I also ended up creating the first version of what would became part of the final symbol.

#### Wait, where did that ⚡ came from?

I wasn't satisfied with having an identity purely based on type. I especially wanted some form of symbol that could work as a little stamp – something I could throw into other projects to tie them back to my main brand. This led to the idea of formatting it like a seal at the end of the logotype.

#### Why a lightning bolt though?

There isn't a single specific reason, but rather a collection of them. I've always loved storms; they bring that humbling feeling of being small in the face of nature's power. The Flash has been one of my favorite heroes since childhood - being so fast you could run on water seemed incredible to a kid riding his bike along the beach. The symbol brought together everything I've always wanted to connect with: energy, movement, speed. It just made sense.
