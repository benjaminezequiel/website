### Preface

There's something particularly challenging about creating your own brand as a designer. While we usually spend our days helping others express their ideas - which can sometimes be a big struggle on its own - turning that energy inwards brings its own set of difficulties.

I waited a while to share this project, partly because I wanted it to be perfect, and partly because I wasn't sure how to add something meaningful to an already noisy digital world (which also made me delay this website launch quite a bit).

But recently, I was reminded that good work doesn't come from waiting for the perfect moment. Like any design project, it's about making decisions, learning from them, and eventually moving on. So here it is: my brand, a reflection of both my professional practice and personal experience, a little mark saying _'I am here, I exist'_ – and maybe I love some of the very specific things you love too.

### How it started

I started working on my brand in early 2023, partly motivated by a desire to put my identity out there, partly by wanting to experiment with visual ideas that didn't quite fit in client projects.

<br>

The first roadblock hit me during the classic designer moment where you test a couple hundred typefaces: what should I even call myself? My name, while lovely (thanks mom and dad for the biblical combo), isn't exactly short. Over the years, different people have known me as Ben, Benji, Min, Benja, and in gaming circles, I've been "Ezben" for as long as I can remember.

<br>
This seemingly simple question of naming revealed a deeper challenge. Every time I settled on an approach (I was _this_ close to going all-in on Ezben), something felt off. Looking at other designers' personal brands, I noticed most had clear, focused objectives – they were either strictly professional or tied to a specific niche. But my situation was different. I wasn't looking to build just a professional identity, because I'm not just a designer. You can't represent a person as a single thing, we are all a combination of all sorts of weird stuff.

While taking a break from my [final undergraduate project](https://www.benjaminezequiel.com/projects/project_panorama), I had an insight: what if instead of fighting this multiplicity, I just embraced it? There's probably no magic answer to converge all of my interests, so I might as well embrace them all. This goes against every piece of advice I've read about branding, which all state that you should _specialize_ and _find your niche_, but it resonated so much more with me. This idea of a "mutant brand" started to take shape – one that could shift and adapt while still feeling cohesive.

### Anything but Beijamim

Throughout my life, I've seen my name written in some really creative ways: Beijamin, Benjamim (yes, that's different, and the worst one), Benjomim – seems like everyone has their own take on it. At some point, I realized this wasn't just an amusing annoyance, but a small opportunity to break some norms when creating my logotype. I'm not the same Benjamin in every context, so my visual identity shouldn't be either. The challenge was creating something solid, visually interesting, and that could maintain its identity whether as Benjamin, Ben, Benji, or even Ezben.

<br>

After a couple of tries, I landed on a solid idea: a lightly altered version of Space Grotesk with variations in both content and layout. It worked well and was flexible enough that I could apply it to different things and contexts. And... I didn't explain the symbol, did I?

### Wait, where did that ⚡ came from?

I wasn't satisfied with having an identity purely based on type. I especially wanted some form of symbol that could work as a little stamp – something I could throw into other projects to tie them back to my main brand. This led to the idea of formatting it like a seal at the end of the logotype.

#### Why a lightning bolt though?

There isn't a single specific reason, but rather a collection of them. I've always loved storms; they bring that humbling feeling of being small in the face of nature's power. The Flash has been one of my favorite heroes since childhood - being so fast you could run on water seemed incredible to a kid riding his bike along the beach. The symbol brought together everything I've always wanted to connect with: energy, movement, speed. It just made sense.

### To B or not to B?
