### Description

SiliconTrader is a modern asset trading platform focused on ultra-low latency and usability. As a designer, I've prioritized creating workflows that speed up users' tasks while ensuring they maintain complete control over the platform.

While most of this project is currently under NDA, you can find some details about it on [MBOCHIP's website](https://mbochip.com/) (which I helped design and develop) and in the [platform's promotional video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7111038887346515968-Jlfd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) (also created by my team).
