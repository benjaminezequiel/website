## Introduction

There's something _particularly challenging_ about creating your own brand. As designers, we usually spend days helping others communicate their ideas, but turning that energy towards your own expression brings a new set of obstacles. The process of being both the **client and designer** taught me new lessons I wasn't expecting.

I've had this project ready for a while now, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with it. The internet [signal-to-noise ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) is already pretty bad, and I really didn't want to push it further. But I also wanted to "put my flag on the moon", explore new ideas in visual design, and share the specific things that fascinate me — things that might resonate with you too.

As always, good work doesn't come from waiting for the perfect opportunity. Like any design project, it's about making decisions, learning from them, and eventually moving on. In this case study, I'll walk you through my process, struggles, and discoveries — hoping you might find something useful for your own journey.

## How it started

I started working on my brand in early 2023, driven partly by that desire to put myself out there, and partly by the freedom to experiment with visual ideas that didn't fit into typical client projects — weird textures, futuristic elements, ASCII art, that sort of stuff.

#### Initial exploration

The first roadblock hit me during the classic design moment where you test a couple hundred typefaces: what should I even call myself? My name, while lovely (thanks mom and dad for the biblical combo), isn't exactly short. Over the years, different people have known me as Ben, Benji, Min, Benja, and in gaming circles, I've been "Ezben" for as long as I can remember.

While working on my [final undergraduate project](https://www.benjaminezequiel.com/projects/project_panorama), I started thinking about how to handle these different versions of my name. Instead of picking just one, I realized I could design a system that works with this variety. Most branding guidelines emphasize consistency and finding a niche, but I needed something more flexible.

#### Requirements

Unlike client work, this was pure experimentation. No briefs, no deadlines, no meetings - just me exploring whatever caught my interest and seeing where it would lead. While the freedom was exciting, it's also part of what made the project challenging. I read a few years ago (probably in an [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) book) that **constraints foster creativity**, and that insight has shaped how I think about this process of playing with ideas.

Rather than letting this become an endless exploration, I turned that insight into action. I created a set of requirements that would push me creatively while keeping the project focused:

> R01: **adapting to different names** - The system needed to work across different platforms and contexts where my full name might not fit or where I might want to use a variation

> R02: **typography variety** - I wanted the freedom to experiment with different typefaces to create richer visual communication, while maintaining a cohesive identity

> R03: **distinctive symbol** - Something unique that could stand alone and be immediately recognizable, and that could be used to identify other personal projects under the same brand

> R04: **bold colors** - A versatile color system that could be used throughout different projects, as a way to connect my experiments

With these requirements in hand, I started exploring different directions, collecting references, and sketching ideas. The rest of the article is organized in sections that explain how I worked around each requirement.

## R01: Adapting to different names

#### Anything but _Beijamim_

Throughout my life, I've seen my name written in some really creative ways: Beijamin, Benjamim (yes, that's different, and the worst one), Benjomim – seems like everyone has their own take on it. At some point, I realized this wasn't just an amusing annoyance, but a small opportunity to break some norms when creating my logotype. I'm not the same Benjamin in every context, so my visual identity shouldn't be either. The challenge was creating something solid, visually interesting, and that could maintain its identity whether as Benjamin, Ben, Benji, or even Ezben.

<span class="secondary-illustration">![Problem Illustration](/images/02-personal-brand/ezben_i04.svg)</span>

After a couple of tries, I landed on a solid idea: a lightly altered version of Space Grotesk with variations in both content and layout. It worked well and was flexible enough that I could apply it to different things and contexts. And... I didn't explain the symbol, did I?

### Wait, where did that ⚡ came from?

I wasn't satisfied with having an identity purely based on type. I especially wanted some form of symbol that could work as a little stamp – something I could throw into other projects to tie them back to my main brand. This led to the idea of formatting it like a seal at the end of the logotype.

#### Why a lightning bolt though?

There isn't a single specific reason, but rather a collection of them. I've always loved storms; they bring that humbling feeling of being small in the face of nature's power. The Flash has been one of my favorite heroes since childhood - being so fast you could run on water seemed incredible to a kid riding his bike along the beach. The symbol brought together everything I've always wanted to connect with: energy, movement, speed. It just made sense.

## [WIP]!

I am still writing the rest of this case study! Come back later for more details.
