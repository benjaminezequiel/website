### Introduction

I've always been deeply interested in the principles of visual communication, and in the years leading up to my thesis, I developed a passion for physical tools (like those from [The Ugly Lab](https://theuglylab.com.br/)) that facilitate creative processes. These interests converged in the creation of a project that helps designers explore their ideas: a tool to expand their visual horizons.

I spent almost a year developing this project, from in-depth theoretical research to extensive exploration and testing, always striving to create the best possible tool. This case study documents my process, hoping to help others interested in developing projects that facilitate creative thinking.

### The Problem

Through studying literature about the creative process, I discovered an interesting problem that emerges from two key premises from Jorge and Jardim (2018):

> "Projects are created through a sequence of decisions, where the designer acts as an active agent in solving a problem"

> "The repertoire and previous experiences of design professionals are determining factors in the decision-making process"

This raises an important question: <span class='highlight'>**how can we help designers at the beginning of their careers**</span>, who haven't yet built a robust repertoire, to understand and make design decisions while learning their craft? This became the central focus of my project.

### Research

My first step was diving deep into design theory, trying to understand how different authors approach and explain design principles. I collected and analyzed over 250 principles, carefully examining how they could be useful for designers starting their careers. More than just gathering information, I wanted to find patterns - ways to organize these principles that would make them practical and accessible.

#### Literature Review

The analysis revealed natural groupings in how principles work: some describe basic properties of visual elements, others guide fundamental decisions we make in every project, and many offer specific strategies for achieving certain effects. This led to organizing the principles into four key categories that would form the foundation of my tool: Properties, Fundamentals, Strategies, and Gestalt principles.

#### Field Research & Insights

To ground the theoretical research in real-world needs, I conducted extensive field research through interviews and surveys. This helped validate assumptions and revealed new insights about how designers learn and apply principles in practice.

The interviews with experienced designers and professors were particularly enlightening, revealing how design expertise develops over time. Many interviewees noted that while some students have natural intuition for design principles, they often struggle to articulate their decisions or explore alternatives beyond their first ideas.

The survey of 43 designers, mostly in their early careers, highlighted specific pain points:

- Difficulty breaking free from initial ideas during ideation
- Uncertainty when making and defending design decisions
- Challenges in translating theoretical knowledge into practical solutions
- A desire for more structured ways to explore visual possibilities

### Defining the Direction

After organizing all this research, I needed to understand exactly who I was designing for. I developed three personas representing different ways people might use the tool: design students looking to understand principles better, professors wanting to teach these concepts more effectively, and professionals seeking to expand their visual repertoire.

These personas helped shape requirements for the project and led to an important realization: the tool needed to balance being educational with being practical - something you could learn from but also use actively in your design process.

### The Concept: _Expanding Visual Horizons_

The name "Panorama" emerged from exploring words related to vision and possibility. It clicked immediately - the idea of having a broad view of all possible design directions perfectly captured what I wanted to create. This concept of "expanding your horizon of visual possibilities" became the foundation for developing the tool's identity.

### Visual Development

Creating the visual identity was particularly challenging because it needed to demonstrate the very principles it was teaching. I explored different approaches, from minimal to expressive, before landing on a solution that felt right: using multiple typefaces in the logo to represent the diversity of visual possibilities, while maintaining clarity and coherence.

The color system and illustrations followed similar thinking. Each category got its own vibrant color, making the cards easy to organize and identify. For the illustrations, I developed a style that could demonstrate each principle clearly while maintaining a cohesive look across all 45 cards.

### The Final Tool

Panorama ended up as a set of 50 cards - 45 principles plus introductory cards for each category. Each card works as both a reference and a practical tool, featuring an abstract illustration that demonstrates the principle, a clear description, and connections to related concepts. I also developed packaging that protects the cards while keeping them easily accessible, and a guidebook that dives deeper into each principle.

Each card features:

- An abstract illustration demonstrating the principle
- A clear, concise description
- Related principles for further exploration
- Category identification through color
- Examples of practical application

### Testing & Refining

Throughout development, I kept testing the tool with other designers. Their feedback was crucial - it helped me refine everything from the card layout to how principles were explained. Watching people interact with the cards showed me what worked and what needed adjustment, leading to several iterations before reaching the final version.

### Impact & Learnings

This project taught me a lot about bridging theory and practice in design. It showed me how physical tools can make complex concepts more approachable and how important it is to keep testing and refining ideas with real users.
The most rewarding part was seeing how designers interacted with the cards - discovering new possibilities and making connections between different principles. It reinforced my belief that we can make design theory more accessible without oversimplifying it.

### Further Reading

For those interested in diving deeper into this project, I've made available both my complete graduation thesisÂ¹ and the presentationÂ² I gave to the graduation committee. The presentation is particularly special to me as it represents one of my best works with Figma, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with smart animations at the time.
